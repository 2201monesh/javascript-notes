# JavaScript Notes

This is an open-source resource for JavaScript learners. While learning Web Development through [**The Odin Project**](https://github.com/TheOdinProject), there are many resources referenced to learn JS, and these notes are basically of them only. The source of these notes is mostly from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), [Mozilla Developer Network Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info). But other sources may also be used for the better understanding of a topic.
